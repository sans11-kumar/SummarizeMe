Create the following icon files in this directory:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels 
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

You can create simple icons using online tools like:
- https://www.canva.com/
- https://www.favicon.cc/
- https://www.flaticon.com/

The icons should represent your Summarize Me extension.
For example, a document with a magnifying glass or a summarized document symbol would be appropriate.

Once you have created these icons, place them in this directory.
